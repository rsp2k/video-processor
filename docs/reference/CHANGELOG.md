## [0.3.0] - 2024-12-XX

### 🎉 Major Release: Complete Test Infrastructure Overhaul

This release represents a massive enhancement to the testing infrastructure, transforming the project from basic functionality to a production-ready, comprehensively tested video processing library.

### ✨ Added

#### 🧪 Comprehensive Test Framework
- **End-to-end Docker integration tests** with PostgreSQL and Procrastinate workers
- **108+ generated test video fixtures** covering all scenarios:
  - Edge cases (single frame, unusual resolutions, extreme aspect ratios)
  - Multiple codecs (H.264, H.265, VP8, VP9, Theora, MPEG4)
  - Audio variations (mono/stereo, different sample rates, no audio, audio-only)
  - Visual patterns (SMPTE bars, RGB test, YUV test, checkerboard)
  - Motion tests (rotation, camera shake, scene changes)
  - Stress tests (high complexity scenes, noise patterns)
- **Synthetic video generator** for creating specific test scenarios
- **Open source video downloader** for Creative Commons test content
- **Test suite manager** with categorized test collections

#### 🐳 Docker & DevOps Infrastructure
- **Complete Docker Compose integration testing** environment
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline** with comprehensive test matrix
- **Makefile** with simplified developer workflows
- **Multi-stage Docker builds** with uv optimization
- **Database migration testing** in containerized environment

#### 📊 Test Coverage Improvements
- **Perfect API compatibility** - 0 failing tests (was 17 failing)
- **52 passing unit tests** (improved from 35)
- **144 total tests** across the entire project
- **Complete mocking strategy** for FFmpeg integration
- **Edge case handling** for all video processing scenarios

#### 🔧 Developer Experience
- **Comprehensive test fixtures** for realistic testing scenarios
- **Integration test examples** for video processing workflows
- **Enhanced error handling** with proper exception hierarchies
- **Production-ready configuration** examples

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements

#### Testing Architecture
- **Sophisticated mocking** for FFmpeg fluent API chains
- **Proper pathlib.Path mocking** for file system operations
- **Comprehensive sprite generation testing** with FixedSpriteGenerator
- **Thumbnail generation testing** with timestamp adjustment logic
- **Error scenario testing** for corrupted files and edge cases

#### Infrastructure
- **Docker service orchestration** for isolated testing
- **PostgreSQL integration** with automated migration testing
- **Procrastinate worker testing** with async job processing
- **Version compatibility testing** for 2.x/3.x migration scenarios

### 🔄 Changed
- **Test suite organization** - reorganized into logical categories
- **Mock implementations** - improved to match actual API behavior  
- **Exception handling** - aligned with actual codebase structure
- **Configuration validation** - enhanced with comprehensive test coverage

### 📋 Migration Guide

#### For Developers
1. **Enhanced Testing**: The test suite now provides comprehensive coverage
2. **Docker Integration**: Use `make test-docker` for full integration testing
3. **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions workflow automatically tests all scenarios
4. **Test Fixtures**: 108+ video files available for realistic testing scenarios

#### Running the New Test Suite
```bash
# Quick unit tests
uv run pytest tests/unit/

# Full integration testing with Docker
make test-docker

# Specific test categories
uv run pytest -m "smoke"    # Quick smoke tests
uv run pytest -m "edge_cases"  # Edge case testing
```

### 🎯 Test Results Summary
- **Before**: 17 failed, 35 passed, 7 skipped
- **After**: 52 passed, 7 skipped, **0 failed**
